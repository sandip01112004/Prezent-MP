# PreZent â€“ Smart Bluetooth Presence Detection App
PreZent is a smart system that uses Bluetooth device scanning to detect nearby mobile devices and logs their presence for attendance or tracking purposes. It leverages an ESP32 device to scan for Bluetooth signals and sends filtered device data to a local MongoDB database via a Node.js backend.
